# Style Guide

## Narrative Voice

### Primary POV
- First-person present tense for the main narrative
- This creates immediacy and allows readers to experience the disorientation of integration alongside the protagonist
- Present tense helps blur the line between past/present/future experiences

### Integration Sequences
1. Primary Timeline
   - Clean, clear first-person present tense
   - Example: "I walk into the room, aware of every detail, every shadow"

2. Memory/Integration Bleeds
   - Italicized first-person, tense shifts based on timeline
   - Example: *The spear feels heavy in my hands. It had always felt heavy, three thousand years ago.*

3. Full Integration Moments
   - Blended tenses, fragmented thoughts
   - Multiple voice markers
   - Example: "I am/was/will be standing at the edge of different centuries, all at once"

## Formatting Conventions

### Timeline Markers
