Proposed Question:
"In 'The Silk Merchant's Letter', you described a ritual performed by the Sogdian merchants before crossing the Tarim Basin. The details match perfectly with a recently discovered fragment of text that won't be published until next month. How did you come to write about this so accurately?"

### The Follow-up
After his awkward attempt to explain research:
"But what about the prayer? The one your merchant whispers at dawn - in the original dialect? The words are identical to what we found inscribed on the tomb wall. That text was sealed for over a thousand years."
