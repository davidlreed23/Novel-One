# System Mechanics and Rules

## Integration Manifestations

### Types of Integration
1. Historical 'Anomalies'
   - Witches/Oracles: Unexplained knowledge
   - Prophets: Future sight/wisdom
   - Historical Geniuses: Advanced understanding beyond their time
   - Mental Health Cases: Multiple personality manifestations

2. Integration Effects
   - Debilitating: Complete personality fragmentation, cognitive breakdown
   - Neutral: Subtle personality shifts, unexplained skills
   - Enhancing: Genius-level insights, prescient abilities
   - Physical: Behavioral changes, muscle memory, instincts

### Core Personality Elements
1. Persistent Traits (Nature)
   - Basic personality framework
   - Core values/ethics
   - Natural aptitudes
   - Psychological patterns

2. Life-Specific Elements (Nurture)
   - Learned behaviors
   - Cultural conditioning
   - Specific memories
   - Acquired skills

## Integration Mechanics

### Variables Affecting Integration
1. Speed of Integration
   - Gradual seepage
   - Sudden floods
   - Triggered events
   - Cascading effects

2. Temporal Distance
   - Near-time integration (minimal dissonance)
   - Far-past integration (primitive/basic)
   - Far-future integration (advanced/complex)
   - Multiple timeline convergence

3. Cognitive Impact
   - Language barriers
   - Technological comprehension gaps
   - Cultural shock
   - Physical capability differences

### Integration Progression
1. Initial Signs
   - Dreams/Déjà vu
   - Unexplained knowledge
   - Skill manifestation
   - Personality shifts

2. Advanced Stages
   - Multiple life awareness
   - Timeline bleeding
   - Reality manipulation
   - Consciousness expansion

## Simulation Framework

### Base Reality Rules
1. Physical Laws
   - Standard physics applies
   - Quantum mechanics as interface
   - Consciousness as data transfer

2. Timeline Management
   - Parallel processing
   - Isolation protocols
   - Breach detection
   - Emergency containment

### Reality Slippage
1. Minor Manifestations
   - Déjà vu incidents
   - Prophetic dreams
   - Unexplained talents

2. Major Breaches
   - Physical law violations
   - Timeline crossovers
   - Mass consciousness events

## Power Dynamics

### Awareness Levels
1. Unaware
   - Standard simulation participants
   - No knowledge of true nature

2. Partially Aware
   - Experiencing integration
   - Seeking understanding

3. Fully Aware
   - Understanding the system
   - Manipulating the collapse

### Antagonist Factions
1. Historical Secret Societies
   - Ancient knowledge keepers
   - Integration manipulation

2. Modern Organizations
   - Scientific research groups
   - Government agencies
   - Corporate interests

3. Individual Actors
   - Advanced integrators
   - System manipulators
   - Reality architects

## Meta-Consciousness

### Hierarchy of Consciousness
1. Individual Lives
   - Single timeline experiences
   - Limited awareness

2. Integrated Beings
   - Multiple timeline awareness
   - Expanded consciousness

3. Higher Dimensional Being
   - Full timeline access
   - Complete awareness

4. Super-Being
   - Collective consciousness
   - Ultimate reality architect

### End-Stage Implications
1. Complete Integration
   - Mass consciousness merging
   - Reality framework breakdown
   - New existence paradigm

2. System Response
   - Automatic corrections
   - Failsafe protocols
   - Evolution triggers
