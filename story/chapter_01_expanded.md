# Chapter 1: The Question

The auditorium lights at Columbia University created the illusion of intimacy, though Michael Barrett knew the room held over four hundred people. He paused in his reading, letting the last words hang in the air. The passage from 'Empire of Salt' was one of his favorites, a pivotal scene that had earned particular praise for its historical authenticity.

"...and so Willem van Hoorn watched as they transferred the gold, not in ingots as was customary, but in crude vessels disguised as ballast. The real ledgers would be burned that night, replaced with forgeries that would survive three centuries in the Granada archives. None of them knew they were creating a system that would outlive empires."

He closed the book. The silence held for a moment before applause filled the room. From the stage, he could make out familiar faces in the front rows - fellow historians, literature professors, his editor Sarah Chen who'd flown in from Boston. The success of his second novel still felt surreal. *Empire of Salt* had spent twenty weeks on the bestseller list, earned a National Book Award nomination, and somehow managed to please both historians and critics. Not bad for what his former academic colleagues still insisted on calling 'popular fiction.'

Dr. Elizabeth Chen, the head of Columbia's History Department and tonight's moderator, gestured him toward the leather chair beside her own. "Thank you, Michael. That passage perfectly illustrates why your work has garnered such attention from the historical community." She adjusted her glasses as he took his seat. "We'll now open the floor for questions."

A hand shot up in the third row. "Dr. Barrett, the Journal of Economic History just published a piece suggesting your portrayal of Dutch East India Company practices has prompted a reevaluation of 17th-century trading patterns. How do you balance historical accuracy with dramatic narrative?"

Michael smiled. "The truth is, history provides better drama than anything I could invent. Take the Dutch East India Company - we're taught this sanitized version of early capitalism, but the reality was far more complex. These were people building global systems we still use today, often through methods we'd consider criminal."

"Following up on that," another voice called from the middle section, "your first book's description of Spanish gold manipulation has been cited in three academic papers. Did you anticipate this kind of scholarly impact?"

"Honestly, no," Michael laughed. "I'm just trying to tell good stories. But I believe if we want to understand our modern financial systems, we need to understand their origins. Sometimes fiction can illuminate historical truth in ways pure academia can't."

Dr. Chen nodded. "Which perhaps explains why the Financial Times called your work 'uncomfortably relevant to modern banking practices.'"

More hands. More questions. Then a woman stood near the back - early thirties, dark hair, wearing what looked like a visiting scholar's badge.

"Dr. Barrett," she said, her accent slightly Germanic, "I'm Dr. Anna Visser from the Dutch National Archives, currently visiting Columbia. In your first novel, 'The Silk Merchant's Letter,' you described a specific banking practice used by the Dutch East India Company in 1628 - a method of obscuring gold transfers through parallel ledgers. Our research team has just discovered documents in a sealed vault in Amsterdam that describe this exact system."

Michael leaned forward, genuinely intrigued. From this angle, he could better see the woman's face, intent and focused beneath the auditorium lights. "That's fascinating, Dr. Visser. The Dutch East India Company's banking practices were instrumental to the plot. I'm pleased to hear my research aligns with your findings."

"Would you be interested to know," she continued, consulting a small notebook, "that these documents were supposedly destroyed in the fire of 1683? Their existence was unknown until our discovery two weeks ago."

"Really?" Michael's eyebrows rose. He shared a brief glance with Dr. Chen beside him. "That's quite a coincidence. Though in historical research, you'd be surprised how often-"

"One final question, if I may," Dr. Visser interrupted, her voice taking on a sharper edge. "In your novel, you named a minor clerk - Pieter van Waterford - who authenticated these transfers. In our newly discovered documents, we found exactly one mention of this name, on a single page of a water-damaged ledger. No other historical record of this man exists anywhere else. Can you explain this?"

The room went perfectly still. Michael opened his mouth to respond, but the words caught in his throat. A sudden wave of dizziness hit him, and for a moment, the auditorium lights seemed to dim. The smell of candle wax filled his nostrils, so strong he could taste it. *Wooden floors creaking beneath his feet. A thin man with wire-rimmed glasses, hands shaking as he signs...*

"I..." he started, gripping the armrest of his chair. "The name was..." He blinked hard, trying to focus. "I believe I found it in my research, though I'd have to check my notes for the exact..." His voice trailed off as another wave of dizziness struck.

A low murmur spread through the audience. He could see Sarah Chen in the front row, leaning forward with concern.

"I think," Dr. Elizabeth Chen interjected, placing a steady hand on the arm of her chair, "we should move to our next questioner. We have many hands up, and Dr. Barrett has been quite generous with his time already." She turned to Michael. "Unless you'd like to add anything?"

"No, thank you," Michael managed, reaching for his water glass. As the next question came from somewhere to his left, he found his hand shaking slightly. Where had he found that name? He'd written it without thinking, he remembered that much, but the source...the source eluded him completely.
