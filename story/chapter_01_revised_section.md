"Dr. Barrett," she said, her accent slightly Germanic, "I'm Dr. Anna Visser from the Dutch National Archives, currently visiting Columbia. In your first novel, 'The Silk Merchant's Letter,' you described a specific banking practice used by the Dutch East India Company in 1628 - a method of obscuring gold transfers through parallel ledgers. Our research team has just discovered documents in a sealed vault in Amsterdam that describe this exact system."

Michael leaned forward in his leather chair, genuinely intrigued. From this angle, he could better see the woman's face, intent and focused beneath the auditorium lights. "That's fascinating, Dr. Visser. The Dutch East India Company's banking practices were instrumental to the plot. I'm pleased to hear my research aligns with your findings."

"Would you be interested to know," she continued, consulting a small notebook, "that these documents were supposedly destroyed in the fire of 1683? Their existence was unknown until our discovery two weeks ago."

"Really?" Michael's eyebrows rose. He shared a brief glance with Dr. Chen beside him. "That's quite a coincidence. Though in historical research, you'd be surprised how often-"

"One final question, if I may," Dr. Visser interrupted, her voice taking on a sharper edge. "The prayer you wrote - the one whispered over the gold. Those words in Old Dutch?" She paused, looking down at her notebook again. "They match exactly with an inscription we found on a strongbox. A strongbox sealed for over three hundred years. Can you explain this?"

The room went perfectly still. Michael opened his mouth to respond, but the words caught in his throat. A sudden wave of dizziness hit him, and for a moment, the auditorium lights seemed to dim. The smell of candle wax filled his nostrils, so strong he could taste it. *Wooden floors creaking beneath his feet. The weight of the strongbox. The whispered words...*

"I..." he started, gripping the armrest of his chair. "The prayer was..." He blinked hard, trying to focus. "I believe I found it in my research, though I'd have to check my notes for the exact..." His voice trailed off as another wave of dizziness struck.

A low murmur spread through the audience. He could see Sarah Chen in the front row, leaning forward with concern.

"I think," Dr. Elizabeth Chen interjected, placing a steady hand on the arm of her chair, "we should move to our next questioner. We have many hands up, and Dr. Barrett has been quite generous with his time already." She turned to Michael. "Unless you'd like to add anything?"

"No, thank you," Michael managed, reaching for his water glass. As the next question came from somewhere to his left, he found his hand shaking slightly. Where exactly had that prayer come from? He'd written it late one night, he remembered that much, but the source...the source eluded him completely.
