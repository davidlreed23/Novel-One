# Chapter 1: The Question

The auditorium lights at Columbia University created the illusion of intimacy, though Michael Barrett knew the room held over four hundred people. He paused in his reading, letting the last words hang in the air. The passage from 'Empire of Salt' was one of his favorites, a pivotal scene that had earned particular praise for its historical authenticity.

"...and so Willem van Hoorn watched as they transferred the gold, not in ingots as was customary, but in crude vessels disguised as ballast. The real ledgers would be burned that night, replaced with forgeries that would survive three centuries in the Granada archives. None of them knew they were creating a system that would outlive empires."

He closed the book. The silence held for a moment before applause filled the room. From the stage, he could make out familiar faces in the front rows - fellow historians, literature professors, his editor Sarah Chen who'd flown in from Boston. The success of his second novel still felt surreal. *Empire of Salt* had spent twenty weeks on the bestseller list, earned a National Book Award nomination, and somehow managed to please both historians and critics. Not bad for what his former academic colleagues still insisted on calling 'popular fiction.'

Dr. Elizabeth Chen, the head of Columbia's History Department and tonight's moderator, stepped up to the podium. "Thank you, Michael. As always, your attention to historical detail is remarkable." She adjusted her glasses. "We'll now open the floor for questions."

The usual hands went up. Michael settled into the familiar rhythm. Yes, the research took about eighteen months. No, he hadn't originally planned a trilogy. Yes, his background as a medieval historian helped with the details.

"But how do you make it feel so real?" A student in the middle rows asked. "It's like you were actually there."

"Good historical fiction requires inhabiting the period," he said, smiling. "You have to imagine yourself there, witnessing events firsthand. The real art is in the details - not just the big historical moments, but the small human things that make it real."

More questions, more answers. Then a hand raised near the back. A woman stood - early thirties, dark hair, wearing what looked like a visiting scholar's badge.

"Dr. Barrett," she said, her accent slightly Germanic, "I found something fascinating in your first novel, 'The Silk Merchant's Letter.' You described a specific banking practice used by the Dutch East India Company in 1628 - a method of obscuring gold transfers through parallel ledgers. Did you know that this exactly matches documents we recently discovered in a sealed vault in Amsterdam?"

"Really?" Michael leaned forward, genuinely interested. Historical validation always pleased him. "That's remarkable. When were these discovered?"

"Two weeks ago," she said. "They'll be published in next month's Journal of Banking History. But what's particularly interesting is your description of the exchange house on the Warmoesstraat, and the clerk, Hendrik van Voorst."

"Ah yes," Michael nodded. "Those details took considerable research." Though now that he thought about it, he couldn't quite remember where he'd found them.

"Would you be interested to know," she continued, "that these documents were supposedly destroyed in the fire of 1683? Their existence was unknown until our discovery."

A slight murmur went through the audience. Michael blinked, trying to recall his research notes. "Sometimes historical fiction gets lucky," he offered. "You'd be surprised how often-"

"One final question, if I may," she interrupted. "The prayer you described, the one whispered over the gold - those words you wrote in Old Dutch? They match exactly with an inscription we found on a strongbox. A strongbox sealed for over three hundred years."

The room went quiet. Michael opened his mouth to respond, but suddenly the words wouldn't come. A wave of dizziness washed over him. Candle wax. He could smell candle wax.

"I think," Dr. Chen stepped in smoothly, "we should move to our next questioner. We have many hands up and limited time."

Michael nodded gratefully, taking a sip of water. But as the next question came, he found himself wondering - where exactly had that prayer come from?
