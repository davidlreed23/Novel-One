# Chapter 1: The Question

The auditorium lights at Columbia University created the illusion of intimacy, though Michael Barrett knew the room held over four hundred people. He paused in his reading, letting the last words hang in the air. The passage he'd chosen from 'Empire of Salt' was one that still unsettled him - not for its content, but for how easily it had flowed from his fingers when he'd written it, as if he'd been transcribing memory rather than crafting fiction.

"...and so Willem van Hoorn watched as they transferred the gold, not in ingots as was customary, but in crude vessels disguised as ballast. The real ledgers would be burned that night, replaced with forgeries that would survive three centuries in the Granada archives. None of them knew they were creating a system that would outlive empires."

He closed the book. The silence held for a moment before applause filled the room. From the stage, he could make out familiar faces in the front rows - fellow historians, literature professors, his editor Sarah Chen who'd flown in from Boston. The success of his second novel still felt surreal. *Empire of Salt* had spent twenty weeks on the bestseller list, earned a National Book Award nomination, and somehow managed to please both historians and critics. Not bad for what his former academic colleagues still insisted on calling 'popular fiction.'

Dr. Elizabeth Chen, the head of Columbia's History Department and tonight's moderator, stepped up to the podium. "Thank you, Michael. As always, your attention to historical detail is remarkable." She adjusted her glasses. "We'll now open the floor for questions."

The usual hands went up. Michael settled into the familiar rhythm of a Q&A session. Yes, the research took about eighteen months. No, he hadn't originally planned a trilogy. Yes, his background as a medieval historian helped with the details.

"But how do you make it feel so real?" A student in the middle rows asked. "It's like you were actually there."

Michael gave his practiced smile. *If you only knew*, he thought, then pushed the idea away. "Good historical fiction requires inhabiting the period," he said. "You have to imagine yourself there, witnessing events firsthand."

More questions, more familiar answers. Then a hand raised near the back. A woman stood - early thirties, dark hair, wearing what looked like a visiting scholar's badge. Something about her made him sit straighter.

"Dr. Barrett," she said, her accent slightly Germanic, "in your first novel, 'The Silk Merchant's Letter,' you described a specific banking practice used by the Dutch East India Company in 1628. A method of obscuring gold transfers through a system of parallel ledgers."

He felt a flutter in his stomach. That passage had written itself late one night, flowing from some place he couldn't quite identify. He'd labeled it fiction because he couldn't cite a source, though it had felt true in his bones.

"Your description matches exactly with documents we recently discovered in a sealed vault in Amsterdam," she continued. "Documents that won't be published until next month's Journal of Banking History. How did you come to write about this so accurately?"

The room had gone very quiet. Michael became aware of Sarah Chen leaning forward in her seat, suddenly intent. He forced a laugh. "Thorough research," he said. "And perhaps a bit of lucky guesswork."

"But the details," the woman pressed. "The specific method of using copper shipments to disguise gold movements. The exact location of the exchange house on the Warmoesstraat. Even the name of the clerk, Hendrik van Voorst." She pulled out a small notebook. "Would you like to know what's most fascinating? The documents we found were supposedly destroyed in the fire of 1683. Their existence was unknown until two weeks ago."

Michael felt a strange doubling in his vision. For a moment, he could smell the candle wax, feel the weight of the ledger in his hands. *Not possible*, he told himself. The memory - if that's what it was - felt as real as the podium under his fingers.

"I..." he started, then stopped as another wave of vertigo hit him. The clerk's face swam in his mind, clear as photograph. Hendrik, worried about his sick daughter, agreeing to help for a thousand guilders. *But I never wrote that detail*, Michael thought. *Did I?*

"Perhaps," Dr. Chen interrupted smoothly, "we should move on to the next question." She gave the woman a pointed look.

But the woman wasn't finished. "One final thing, Dr. Barrett. The prayer you described, the one whispered over the gold? The words you wrote in Old Dutch?" She smiled, and something in that smile made his skin crawl. "They match exactly with an inscription we found on a strongbox. A strongbox sealed for over three hundred years."

The room erupted in murmurs. Michael gripped the podium as the world seemed to tilt. Because he suddenly remembered writing those words. Remembered them flowing onto the page at three in the morning, his fingers moving almost without his control.

What he didn't remember was researching them.

What he couldn't explain was how he knew they were true.
