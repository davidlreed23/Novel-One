# Multi-Observer Reality System

## Individual Reality Bubbles

### Personal Timeline
1. Primary Observation Zone
   - Direct quantum field collapse by observer
   - Immediate reality crystallization
   - Personal choice/action space
   - Maximum influence area

2. Interface Layer
   - Integration with other observers' collapses
   - Reality consensus building
   - Probability field harmonization
   - Conflict resolution mechanics

## System Management

### Reality Consensus
1. Normal Operation
   - Each observer collapses local fields
   - System harmonizes overlapping collapses
   - Creates consistent shared reality
   - Maintains individual agency

2. Operational Rules
   - Primary observer dominates local space
   - Adjacent observers' states respected
   - Conflicts resolved by probability weighting
   - System maintains overall coherence

### Harmonic Resolution
1. Direct Interaction
   - Both observers' collapses equally weighted
   - System creates consensus reality
   - Maintains causal consistency
   - Preserves individual experiences

2. Indirect Interaction
   - Background probability fields
   - Low-priority resolution
   - Flexible state maintenance
   - Minimal observer impact

## Integration Problems

### Timeline Bleeding
1. Normal Barriers
   - Keep each observer isolated
   - Maintain separate probability collapses
   - Prevent timeline interference
   - Allow harmonic interaction

2. Current Crisis
   - Barriers breaking down
   - Multiple timeline collapses mixing
   - Interference patterns emerging
   - System strain increasing

### Cascade Effects
1. Local Impact
   - Personal reality confusion
   - Memory integration conflicts
   - Causality discontinuities
   - Experience blending

2. System Impact
   - Reality consensus breaking
   - Probability field destabilization
   - Timeline barrier failure
   - Simulation strain

## Simulation Architecture

### Base Structure
1. Individual Threads
   - Personal timeline tracks
   - Local probability fields
   - Direct observation zones
   - Agency spaces

2. Interaction Layer
   - Cross-observer harmonization
   - Reality consensus building
   - Probability field integration
   - Conflict resolution

### System Priorities
1. Primary Goals
   - Maintain individual agency
   - Enable shared reality
   - Preserve causality
   - Support evolution

2. Operational Requirements
   - Timeline isolation
   - Reality consensus
   - Probability harmony
   - System stability
