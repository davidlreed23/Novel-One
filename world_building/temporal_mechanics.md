# Temporal Mechanics of Integration

## Base Reality Structure

### Traditional Time Model
- All moments exist simultaneously
- Experienced linearly by consciousness
- Fixed events in 4D space

### Simulation Variant
- All moments exist as probability fields
- Events crystallize through observation/interaction
- Similar to quantum wave function collapse

## Integration Effects

### Knowledge Transfer Impact
1. Forward Knowledge (Past to Present)
   - Already part of crystallized timeline
   - Contributes to known history
   - Stable information loop

2. Backward Knowledge (Future to Past)
   - Creates new probability branches
   - Requires timeline recalculation
   - System must reconcile changes

### System Response

1. Local Changes
   - Immediate environment adjusts
   - Minimal ripple effect
   - Limited timeline impact

2. Major Changes
   - Cascade effect through timeline
   - System strain increases
   - Reality stability threatened

## Timeline Mechanics

### Stability Maintenance
1. Auto-Correction
   - System attempts to minimize changes
   - Preserves critical path events
   - Maintains causal chains

2. Breaking Points
   - Too many changes accumulate
   - System cannot maintain stability
   - Timeline barriers fail

### Integration Management
1. Normal Operation
   - Timeline barriers intact
   - Experiences remain isolated
   - Linear perception maintained

2. Current Crisis
   - Barriers failing
   - Experiences bleeding
   - Timeline stability compromised

## The Current Problem

### System Stress
1. Cause
   - Future entity's interference
   - Accelerating integrations
   - Compounding changes

2. Effect
   - Timeline instability
   - Reality breakdown
   - System failure threat

### Observable Symptoms
1. Minor
   - Déjà vu
   - Unexplained knowledge
   - Memory anomalies

2. Major
   - Full integrations
   - Reality glitches
   - Timeline bleeds

## Story Implications

### Narrative Opportunities
1. Personal Level
   - Character experiencing changes
   - Memory conflicts
   - Reality questioning

2. Global Level
   - System breakdown signs
   - Reality instability
   - Timeline conflicts

### Plot Mechanics
1. Integration Events
   - Can change past events
   - Create new timelines
   - Force system adjustments

2. Story Progress
   - Changes accumulate
   - System strain increases
   - Reality becomes unstable

## Critical Rules

### Timeline Changes
1. Small Changes
   - System can auto-correct
   - Limited ripple effect
   - Reality remains stable

2. Large Changes
   - System struggles to adjust
   - Cascade effects occur
   - Reality destabilizes

### Integration Limits
1. Personal Level
   - Individual can handle limited integrations
   - Too many cause mental strain
   - Reality perception breaks down

2. System Level
   - Can manage isolated incidents
   - Multiple integrations cause strain
   - Too many lead to collapse
